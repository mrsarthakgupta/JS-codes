# JavaScript and Classes

## OOP

- Object-Oriented Programming: a way to organize code using objects.

## Object

- A collection of properties (data) and methods (functions).
- Example method: toLowerCase() is a string method that converts text to lowercase.

## Why Use OOP

- To write clean, reusable, and organized code like real-world systems.

## Parts of OOP

Object Literal  : Creating objects directly using {}.

* Constructor Function : A function used to create multiple similar objects.
* Prototypes : Shared methods that are accessible by all objects made from a constructor.

* Classes : Cleaner and modern way to write constructor + prototype logic.
* Instances (new, this) : 'new' creates an object from a class; 'this' refers to that object.

## 4 Pillars

Abstraction

- Hiding complex code and showing only the necessary parts.

Encapsulation

- Wrapping data and functions together, and hiding private details.

Inheritance

- One class can access the features of another class.

Polymorphism

- One function behaves differently based on the object calling it.
