/* 
Getter: A getter is a method that lets you access a property as if it's a normal variable, but you can add logic behind it.
Setter: A setter is a method that lets you set/change a property, again with custom logic, like validation or transformation.

why to use getters and setters? 
1.Control Access: You can control how properties are accessed and modified. 
2.Validation: You can add validation logic when setting a property.
3.Modify output: You can modify the output of a property when it's accessed.    
4.Encapsulation: It helps in encapsulating the internal representation of the object.
5.Avoid Direct Access: It prevents direct access to the internal state of an object, allowing you to change the internal implementation without affecting external code.
